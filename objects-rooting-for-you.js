/* Code from a fellow student, with a different approach using the Math.max() method. 

const judgeVegetable = (vegetable, metrics) => {
  let metricResult = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < vegetable.length; i++) {
    metricResult.push(vegetable[i][metrics]);
  }
  let highestscore = Math.max(â€¦metricResult);
  for (let i = 0; i < vegetable.length; i++) {
    if (vegetable[i][metrics] === highestscore) {
      return vegetable[i].submitter;
